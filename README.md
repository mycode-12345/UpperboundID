In the source file "CalLambda.cpp", the function "unsigned int Lambda(unsigned char P[n][n])" is given. What's more, in the main function, an example calling Lambda() to calculate the parameter "lambda" for Midori128 encryption rounds is given. Here, the parameter "lambda" denotes the maximal number of rounds of Midori128 that can expand any intput pattern to the all-one pattern.
