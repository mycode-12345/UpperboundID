In the source file "ExpansionIndex.cpp", the function "unsigned int ExpansionIndex(unsigned char P[n][n])" is given. What's more, in the main function, an example calling ExpansionIndex() to calculate the parameter "Expansion Index" for Midori128 encryption rounds is given. Here, the parameter "Expansion Index" denotes the maximal number of rounds of Midori128 that can expand any intput pattern to the all-one pattern.
